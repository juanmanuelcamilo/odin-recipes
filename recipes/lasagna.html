    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <h4><u>Step 1</u>:</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>The base:</strong> Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in
      the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive
      oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly
      wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until
      smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to
      rise if you like, but it is not essential for a thin crust.
    </p>
    <h4><u>Step 2</u>:</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic
      together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while
      you get on with shaping the base.
    </p>
    <h4><u>Step 3</u>:</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Out the dough:</strong> if you have let the dough rise, give it a
      quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the
      dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough
      needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto
      two floured baking sheets.
    </p>
    <h4><u>Step 4</u>:</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>And bake:</strong> heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put
      another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top
      shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with
      cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza,
      still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for
      8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil
      leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
